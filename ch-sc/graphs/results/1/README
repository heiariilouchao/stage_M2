The dz plots are slightly shifted:
 - for the positive electrode the shift is of +3.0e-04 Å
 - for the negative one the shift is of -4.0e-04 Å
The reason for this is unknown though:
It could be caused by the ploarization of the system, but this is not likely to be the case since the periodic boundary conditions have been used ;
Also, by construction of the system, the two electrodes are initially identical and this cannot be the cause of this observation.

For the average charges, the plots are
