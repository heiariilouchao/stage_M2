For the relaxation, the temperature is ramping up to 300 K and the pressure stabilizes from 100.000 iterations (<=> .01 ns) as implemented by the thermostat/barostat.

For the main simulation, the pressure is the only reliable indicator of equilibrium because: the temperature is controlled by the thermostat, and the total potential energy is infuenced by the ions displacements or interactions with the electrodes.
From the pressure plot, we can safely assume that the system has reached equilibrium after 4.000.000 iterations (<=> .4 ns).

    => Discussion: the simulation workflow could have been better by starting the system polarization after it had reached equilibrium.
