    # Note: Since we are using RATTLE constraints, the bond and angle strength
    # parameters ("600.0", "75.0") do not matter. But the equilibrium bond
    # length ("1.0") and equilibrium angle ("109.47") does matter. LAMMPS
    # obtains these numbers from the bond_coeff and angle_coeff commands above.
