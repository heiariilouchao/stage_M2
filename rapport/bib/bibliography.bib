	abstract = {The reactive force-field ({ReaxFF}) interatomic potential is a powerful computational tool for exploring, developing and optimizing material properties. Methods based on the principles of quantum mechanics ({QM}), while offering valuable theoretical guidance at the electronic level, are often too computationally intense for simulations that consider the full dynamic evolution of a system. Alternatively, empirical interatomic potentials that are based on classical principles require significantly fewer computational resources, which enables simulations to better describe dynamic processes over longer timeframes and on larger scales. Such methods, however, typically require a predefined connectivity between atoms, precluding simulations that involve reactive events. The {ReaxFF} method was developed to help bridge this gap. Approaching the gap from the classical side, {ReaxFF} casts the empirical interatomic potential within a bond-order formalism, thus implicitly describing chemical bonding without expensive {QM} calculations. This article provides an overview of the development, application, and future directions of the {ReaxFF} method.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Nanoporous carbon texture makes fundamental understanding of the electrochemical processes challenging. Based on density functional theory ({DFT}) results, the proposed atomistic approach takes into account topological and chemical defects of the electrodes and attributes to them a partial charge that depends on the applied voltage. Using a realistic carbon nanotexture, a model is developed to simulate the ionic charge both at the surface and in the subnanometric pores of the electrodes of a supercapacitor. Before entering the smallest pores, ions dehydrate at the external surface of the electrodes, leading to asymmetric adsorption behavior. Ions in subnanometric pores are mostly fully dehydrated. The simulated capacitance is in qualitative agreement with experiments. Part of these ions remain irreversibly trapped upon discharge.
          , 
            Ion desolvation and confinement are key physical processes in porous carbon-based supercapacitors undergoing charging and discharging cycles. We investigate electrolyte interactions between polarized porous carbon with subnanometer pore sizes and aqueous sodium chloride electrolyte, using molecular dynamics. Inspired by recent first-principles calculations, we develop a scheme accounting for chemical defects in electrodes where only the non-sp2 carbons species carry an extra negative charge (on the anode) and an extra positive charge (on the cathode) due to voltage polarization. This drives electrolyte species (ions and solvent molecules; water, in this work) to adsorb at the electrode surface and in subnanometric pores upon polarization. First, we observe an asymmetrical desolvation process of sodium and chloride ions at the external surface of the electrodes. The ionic distribution at the external surface of the electrodes is consistent with the Debye–Hückel electric potential equation and empirical trends observed for nonporous electrodes. In a second stage, we demonstrate that the nanoporosity of the electrodes is filled with ions and scarce water molecules and contributes to about 20\% of the overall capacitance. A fraction of desolvated ions are irreversibly trapped in the core of electrodes during discharge. While maintaining the overall electroneutrality of the simulation cell, we find that anodes and cathodes do not carry the same amount of ions at all time steps, leading to charge imbalance.},

	abstract = {Adequate initial conﬁgurations for molecular dynamics simulations consist of arrangements of molecules distributed in space in such a way to approximately represent the system’s overall structure. In order that the simulations are not disrupted by large van der Waals repulsive interactions, atoms from different molecules must keep safe pairwise distances. Obtaining such a molecular arrangement can be considered a packing problem: Each type molecule must satisfy spatial constraints related to the geometry of the system, and the distance between atoms of different molecules must be greater than some speciﬁed tolerance. We have developed a code able to pack millions of atoms, grouped in arbitrarily complex molecules, inside a variety of three-dimensional regions. The regions may be intersections of spheres, ellipses, cylinders, planes, or boxes. The user must provide only the structure of one molecule of each type and the geometrical constraints that each type of molecule must satisfy. Building complex mixtures, interfaces, solvating biomolecules in water, other solvents, or mixtures of solvents, is straightforward. In addition, different atoms belonging to the same molecule may also be restricted to different spatial regions, in such a way that more ordered molecular arrangements can be built, as micelles, lipid double-layers, etc. The packing time for state-of-the-art molecular dynamics systems varies from a few seconds to a few minutes in a personal computer. The input ﬁles are simple and currently compatible with {PDB}, Tinker, Molden, or Moldy coordinate ﬁles. The package is distributed as free software and can be downloaded from http://www.ime.unicamp.br/∼martinez/packmol/.},

The method describes the equilibration of external electrochemical potentials (voltage) within metallic structures and their eﬀect on the self consistent partial atomic charges used in reactive molecular dynamics. An additional variable assigned to each atom denotes the local potential in its vicinity and we use ﬁctitious, but computationally convenient, dynamics to describe its equilibration within not-simply connected metallic structures on-the-ﬂy during the molecular dynamics simulation. This local electrostatic potential is used to dynamically modify the atomic electronegativities used to compute partial atomic changes via charge equilibration. Validation tests show that the method provides an accurate description of the electric ﬁelds generated by the applied voltage and the driving force for electrochemical reactions. We demonstrate {EChemDID} via simulations of the operation of electrochemical metallization cells. The simulations predict the switching of the device between a high-resistance to a low-resistance state as a conductive metallic bridge is formed and resistive currents that can be compared with experimental measurements. In addition to applications in nanoelectronics, {EChemDID} could be useful to model electrochemical energy conversion devices.},

	abstract = {Neutron diraction data for water and ice in the form of {OO}, {OH} and {HH} partial structure factors now exist over a temperature range 220±673 K, and at pressures up to \$400 {MPa}. In order for these data to be useful for comparing with dierent computer simulations and theories of water, it is ®rst necessary to Fourier transform them to the corresponding site±site radial distribution functions. The process of doing this is not straightforward because of the inherent systematic uncertainties in the data, which arise primarily in the case of neutron scattering, from the inelasticity or recoil eects that can distort the experimental data. In this paper, it is shown that the empirical potential structure re®nement procedure, which attempts to ®t a three-dimensional ensemble of water molecules to all three partial structure factors simultaneously, leads to improved reliability in the extracted radial distribution functions. There are still some uncertainties, primarily associated with the hardness of the repulsive core of the intermolecular potential, which current data are not precise enough to resolve. The derived empirical potentials show some variability associated with particular experiments. General trends can be discerned however which indicate polarisation eects may be signi®cant when eective intermolecular potentials are used over a wide temperature and density range.

	abstract = {Electrical double layer ({EDL}) capacitors based on recently emergent graphene materials have shown several folds performance improvement compared to conventional porous carbon materials, driving a wave of technology breakthrough in portable and renewable energy storage. Accordingly, much interest has been generated to pursue a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental yet elusive double layer structure at the electrode/electrolyte interface. In this paper, we carried out comprehensive molecular dynamics simulations to obtain a comprehensive picture of how ion type, solvent properties, and charging conditions affect the {EDL} structure at the graphene electrode surface, and thereby its contribution to capacitance. We show that different symmetrical monovalent aqueous electrolytes M+X– (M+ = Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+; X– = F–, Cl–, and I–) indeed have distinctive {EDL} structures. Larger ions, such as, Rb+, Cs+, Cl–, and I–, undergo partial dehydration and penetrate through the first water layer next to the graphene electrode surfaces under charging. As such, the electrical potential distribution through the {EDL} strongly depends on the ion type. Interestingly, we further reveal that the water can play a critical role in determining the capacitance value. The change of dielectric constant of water in different electrolytes largely cancels out the variance in electric potential drop across the {EDL} of different ion type. Our simulation sheds new lights on how the interplay between solvent molecules and {EDL} structure cooperatively contributes to capacitance, which agrees with our experimental results well.},

              Electrolytes have been identified as some of the most influential components in the performance of electrochemical supercapacitors ({ESs}), which include: electrical double-layer capacitors, pseudocapacitors and hybrid supercapacitors. This paper reviews recent progress in the research and development of {ES} electrolytes. The electrolytes are classified into several categories, including: aqueous, organic, ionic liquids, solid-state or quasi-solid-state, as well as redox-active electrolytes. Effects of electrolyte properties on {ES} performance are discussed in detail. The principles and methods of designing and optimizing electrolytes for {ES} performance and application are highlighted through a comprehensive analysis of the literature. Interaction among the electrolytes, electro-active materials and inactive components (current collectors, binders, and separators) is discussed. The challenges in producing high-performing electrolytes are analyzed. Several possible research directions to overcome these challenges are proposed for future efforts, with the main aim of improving {ESs}' energy density without sacrificing existing advantages (
              e.g.
              , a high power density and a long cycle-life) (507 references).},

	abstract = {One of the issues recently faced in electrostatic field is storage. With recent advances in this area it has become necessary to find an alternative which lead to emergence of supercapacitor. Supercapacitor shares the same fundamental equations as conventional capacitors; to attain higher capacitances supercapacitor uses electrodes having high specific surface area and thinner dielectrics. With these properties it makes them have power densities greater than those of batteries and energy density greater than those of conventional capacitors. Since supercapacitor is mainly a pulse current device it is best used with devices that require high current for short duration of time. Researchers being carried out now are on how to improve the energy density so that they can be used in wider range of applications. The performance of supercapacitor relies on factors such as electrochemical properties of electrode materials used, electrolyte and voltage range. However, most researches are focused on the development of new electrode materials that will yield better performances. In this review paper, storage principle and characteristics of electrode materials such as carbon based materials, metal oxides and conducting polymers in supercapacitors have been reported.},
